# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Description
This project tracks MBTA buses and displays buses along a selected route on the map. Users can choose a bus route by inputting a bus route number. When clicking on the markers that represent each bus, you can see the bus route and bus ID. The map updates every 5 seconds with real-time data from MBTA.

## How to Run
The map will load upon loading the [webpage](https://emilylubkert.github.io/Real-Time-Bus-Tracker/). Bus markers will appear after you type a bus route into the input box and click the button. To try it out, enter "1" to track buses along Route 1.

## Roadmap of future improvements 
- Refine code to improve marker updating capability
- Display which direction bus is headed (based on current terminal stop) in marker

## License information
